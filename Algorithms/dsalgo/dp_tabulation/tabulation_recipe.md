Visualize the problem as a table
Size the table based on the inputs 
    - Think about what is going to change throughout the problem. Like targetSum in canSum problem, we can make a table with the len of targetSum + 1.
Initialize the table with default values
Seed the trivial answer into the table (base case value)
Iterate through the table
Fill further positions based on the current position
